# Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in network traffic data to identify potential security threats and performance issues. The primary objective is to implement an effective anomaly detection system that analyzes network traffic patterns and flags unusual behavior. By utilizing various algorithms and techniques, this project aims to enhance network security and improve overall performance monitoring.

## Features

The anomaly detection system offers several features, including real-time monitoring of network traffic, implementation of multiple anomaly detection algorithms, and visualization of detected anomalies for easy interpretation. Additionally, it provides logging and reporting functionalities for identified anomalies, along with configurable thresholds that can be adjusted to suit specific network conditions.

## Technologies Used

The project is built using Python and leverages several powerful libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn for machine learning, and Matplotlib or Seaborn for data visualization. These technologies work together to facilitate efficient data processing and analysis, enabling effective anomaly detection in network traffic.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, ensure you have Python 3.x and pip installed on your machine. Begin by cloning the repository to your local environment using the command `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anomaly-detection-network-traffic.git`. After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

To run the anomaly detection system, execute the command `python main.py` in your terminal. Before running the program, make sure to update the configuration settings in `config.py` to fit your specific network traffic data and detection requirements. This flexibility allows you to tailor the system to various network environments.

## Results

The output of the system will include detected anomalies, visualizations showing traffic patterns alongside flagged anomalies, and performance metrics for the detection algorithms. These results are essential for understanding the network's behavior and identifying potential issues. A sample output visualization can be found in the project files.
